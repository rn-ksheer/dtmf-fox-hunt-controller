## 📡 About the Project
This project is an **Arduino-based Fox Hunt Transmitter** designed for amateur-radio fox hunting.
Unlike conventional fox hunt transmitters that use a fixed tone or single fixed message, this transmitter allows multiple audio messages stored on a DFPlayer Mini SD card to be remotely selected using DTMF tones.

Remote DTMF commands are received by the fox radio, decoded by the Arduino, and used to select the required audio. The selected audio is then played through the DFPlayer Mini and transmitted over the radio.
Audio files can also be replaced or customized directly on the SD card without modifying the transmitter hardware.

### Background / Motivation
Towards the end of 2024, Rajan Sir (VU2JXM) approached me with his requirement to build a Fox Hunt Transmitter. I started by studying existing designs, including an [Instructables project](https://www.instructables.com/HAM-Radio-Foxhunt-Transmitter-for-CW-or-Morris-Cod/) and YouTube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4b0fNvXA10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL353Il93vI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5HwckW3P3s

My first build followed the Instructables design using a relay and an Adafruit Sound Board provided by Rajan Sir. After working with it, I found the Sound Board expensive and difficult to source, so I replaced it with a locally available **DFPlayer Mini**.

I later replaced the mechanical relay used for PTT with a **MOSFET-based switching** circuit. After several iterations, I eliminated the remaining relay and Arduino-generated Morse tones, moving all audio playback to the DFPlayer Mini.
The result is the compact, practical, and easy-to-build Fox Hunt Transmitter presented in this repository.

This project is therefore not simply a copy of the original design, but the result of several iterations and improvements made while developing a more compact and practical Fox Hunt Transmitter.

# 💻 Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno
- DFRobot DFPlayer Mini library/DTMF library/SoftwareSerial library are included.
- The project has been **tested on an Arduino Nano**.
- It should also work on other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers supported by the Arduino IDE, provided that the required libraries, memory, pins, and serial interfaces are available.

---


# 📥 Installation

## 1. Download or clone the **entire repository**. 

- Do not copy only the main `.ino` file.
- All required source files are part of the project.
---


## 2. Keep All Source Files Together

Make sure all required `.cpp` and `.h` files are located in the **same folder as the main Arduino sketch**.
Example project structure: 

```text
arduino-nano-fox-hunt-transmitter/
 │
 ├── fox_hunt_transmitter.ino
 ├── DTMF.cpp
 ├── DTMF.h
 ├── other_required.cpp
 ├── other_required.h
 │
 └─── mp3/
     ├── 0001.mp3
     ├── 0002.mp3
     ├── 0003.mp3
     └── ...
```
---

## 💾 SD Card Setup

The repository contains a folder named:

```text
mp3
```

Copy the **entire** **`mp3`** **folder** to the SD card that will be inserted into the DFPlayer Mini.

### ⚠️ Do NOT rename the folder

The folder must remain:

```text
mp3
```

The audio files inside the folder can be replaced with your own recordings.

However, the **four-digit numbering format must be maintained**.

Use:

```text
0001.mp3
0002.mp3
0003.mp3
0004.mp3
....
```

Example:

```text
mp3/
├── 0001.mp3
├── 0002.mp3
├── 0003.mp3
├── 0004.mp3
├── 0005.mp3
└── ....
```

### Important

You can replace the audio content with your own recordings, but **do not change the required file numbering format**.

For example, `0009.mp3` can contain any audio message you want, but the filename must remain:

`0009.mp3`

The **four-digit numbering format** is required for the DFPlayer Mini to correctly recognize and access the audio files used by this project.

---

## 🛠️ Arduino IDE Setup

Open the main `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

Select the appropriate board.

### Arduino Nano
Tools → Board → Arduino AVR Boards → Arduino Nano

or:

### Arduino Uno
Tools → Board → Arduino AVR Boards → Arduino Uno

For an Arduino Nano, select the appropriate processor/bootloader option for your particular Nano if required.

##### Then select the correct COM port:

Tools → Port

Compile and upload the sketch.

---

## 🎙️ DTMF Audio Switching

The transmitter uses ***DTMF tones received through the radio/audio input*** to remotely select audio tracks.

The basic operation is:
```text
Remote Radio
     │
   DTMF
     ▼
Fox Radio
  Receiver
     │
     ▼
  Arduino
DTMF Decoder
     │
     ▼
DFPlayer Mini
     │
 Selected Audio
     ▼
Fox Radio
Transmitter
     │
    RF
     ▼
Remote Radio
```

The remote operator simply transmits the required DTMF key.

The Arduino detects the DTMF command and selects the corresponding audio file from the DFPlayer Mini.

---

## 🔢 DTMF Commands

| DTMF Key | Action                      | Audio File |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| `1`      | Start automatic looping     | `0009.mp3` |
| `2`      | Start automatic looping     | `0010.mp3` |
| `3`      | Start automatic looping     | `0011.mp3` |
| `4`      | Play once                   | `0002.mp3` |
| `5`      | Play once                   | `0008.mp3` |
| `6`      | Play once                   | `0007.mp3` |
| `7`      | Play once                   | `0006.mp3` |
| `9`      | Stop looping / transmission | —          |

### Example

If the remote operator sends:

```text
1
```

the transmitter selects:

```text
mp3/0009.mp3
```

and starts the automatic transmission loop.

Similarly:

```text
2 → 0010.mp3
3 → 0011.mp3
```

This makes it possible to remotely switch between different audio messages without physically accessing the transmitter.

## 🔁 Automatic Audio Loop

DTMF commands `1`, `2`, and `3` start the automatic audio loop.

The default timing is:

        ┌───────────────────┐
        │     60 SEC ON     │
        │    Audio TX ON    │
        └─────────┬─────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
        ┌───────────────────┐
        │    60 SEC OFF     │
        │     No TX         │
        └─────────┬─────────┘
                  │
                  └──────────────► Repeat

During the **ON phase**, the selected audio plays continuously.

If the audio file finishes before the 60-second ON period is complete, the same audio file is automatically restarted.

After 60 seconds:

- PTT is released
- Audio transmission stops
- External LED turns OFF
- The transmitter remains OFF for 60 seconds

After the OFF period, the selected audio starts again automatically.

---

## ⏱️ Changing the Loop Duration

The ON and OFF duration can be changed in the Arduino source code.

The main setting is:

const unsigned long LOOP_DURATION = 60000UL;

Examples:

30000UL   = 30 seconds

60000UL   = 60 seconds

120000UL  = 120 seconds

The same value is used for both the ON and OFF periods.

---

## 💡 LED Indicators
### Arduino Onboard LED

The Arduino onboard LED indicates that automatic looping is active.

##### Default blink timing:

ON  → 1 second
OFF → 1 second

The blink speed can be changed using:

const unsigned long LED_BLINK_MS = 1000UL;

#### External LED

The external LED indicates transmitter/audio activity.

It turns ON when the transmitter is keyed and turns OFF when the transmission/audio ends.

## 📝 Important Notes
- The project has been tested on an **Arduino Nano** with **Baofeng UV-5R and UV-82** radios.
- **Arduino Uno** is also supported by the current design.
- Other Arduino-compatible microcontrollers may work if they are supported by the **Arduino IDE** and the required libraries.
- Keep the **`mp3`** folder name unchanged.
- Maintain the **four-digit MP3 file numbering format** (for example, `0001.mp3`, `0002.mp3`, `0009.mp3`).
- **BS170 and 2N7000 are not pin-compatible.** Always check the transistor pinout before substituting one for the other.
- Use a properly formatted SD card that is compatible with the **DFPlayer Mini**.
- Always verify the **radio, transmitter, audio, PTT, and power connections** before operating the transmitter.
